  <h2>Sundar Pichai</h2>
  <p>Pichai worked in engineering and product management at Applied Materials and in management consulting at McKinsey & Company.
   Pichai joined Google in 2004, where he led the product management and innovation efforts for a suite of Google's
    client software products, including Google Chrome and Chrome OS, as well as being largely responsible for Google Drive. 
    He went on to oversee the development of other applications such as Gmail and Google Maps. 
    On November 19, 2009, Pichai gave a demonstration of Chrome OS; the Chromebook was released for trial and testing in 2011, 
    and released to the public in 2012.</p>

  <h2> Digital marketing</h2>
  <p>The development of digital marketing is inseparable from technology development. One of the first key events happened in 1971, 
      when Ray Tomlinson sent the first email, and his technology set the platform to allow people to send and receive files through 
      different machines.[8] However, the more recognizable period as being the start of Digital Marketing is 1990 as this was where
       the Archie search engine was created as an index for FTP sites. </p>

  <h2>Amazon Web Services</h2>
  <p>The AWS platform was launched in July 2002.[5] In its early stages, the platform consisted of only a few disparate tools and 
      services. Then in late 2003, the AWS concept was publicly reformulated when Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black presented a paper
       describing a vision for Amazon's retail computing infrastructure that was completely standardized, completely automated, and 
       would rely extensively on web services for services such as storage and would draw on internal work already underway. </p>
